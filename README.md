# Laptopia online store

The "Laptopia" is an online store for laptops and other computer equipment. This project has only the front-end part, so most of the functionality is hardcoded, but the site has many interactive parts such as sliders, accordions, mobile menu and much more. The site is adapted for mobile screens.
This site uses a [starter template](https://template.fls.guru/) with gulp and webpack.
